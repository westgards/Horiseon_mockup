## Description

This is the mockup for the Horiseon website. Horiseon knows that it is important for their buisness to support web accessibilty while also increasing their presence in search engine hits. 
In this project, we will add accessibilty features to the code base by implementing semantic HTML, increase the number of `alt` attributes, and refactor the structure of some of the HTML elements.
